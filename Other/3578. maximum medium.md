[3578. maximum medium](https://www.acwing.com/problem/content/description/3581/)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Binary Search on values between arr[0] and arr[n // 2] + k</br>
Say the answer is x. If the array is sorted in ascending order, we can see values of elements after median.</br>
In order to let x be the median, we want to make sure value of each element after median is >= x (so that x would be the median).</br>
If not, we need to distribute k to the element, such that its value = k.</br>

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

check(mid):
True: k is enough for mid to be the medium. (so mid should be larger)
False: k is not enough for mid to be the medium. (so mid should be smaller)

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
    O(n log n + log (2* 10^9))
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
    O(1)
# Code
```python
# assume n is odd
def check(mid, n, k, arr):
    for i in range(n//2, n):
        k -= max(0, mid - arr[i])
        if k < 0:
            return False
    return True

# main function
n, k = map(int, input().split(" "))
arr = input().split(" ")
arr = [int(x) for x in arr]
arr.sort()
# print(arr)

# binary search on [arr[0], arr[n//2]+k]
l, r = arr[0], arr[n//2] + k
while l < r:
    mid = (l+r) // 2 + 1
    if check(mid, n, k, arr):
        l = mid
    else:
        r = mid - 1

print(l)
