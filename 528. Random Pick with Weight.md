[528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/description/)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Suppose input = [1,3,5].</br>
We make a board: [1,4,9] (means [(1), (2,3,4) ,(5,6,7,8,9)]).</br>
and pick a random integer rNum as index, ranging from 1 to 9.</br>
Say rNum = 4, it falls at the first parentheses, so we output 1.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
bisect_left on board return exactly what we need.</br>
bisect_left(array, value) return the leftmost index for value to insert

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
    O(log N)

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
    O(N) (N: # of elements in w)

# Code
## bisect_left
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        self.nowSum = 0
        self.board = []
        for weight in w:
            self.nowSum += weight
            self.board.append(self.nowSum)
        
    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        rNum = random.randint(1, self.nowSum)
        idx = bisect_left(self.board, rNum)
        return idx


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
```

## bisect_right
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        self.nowSum = 0
        self.board = []
        for weight in w:
            self.nowSum += weight
            self.board.append(self.nowSum)
        
    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        rNum = random.randint(1, self.nowSum)
        idx = bisect_right(self.board, rNum)
        if idx != 0 and rNum == self.board[idx-1]:
            idx -= 1
        return idx

# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
```
