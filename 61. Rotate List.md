# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Example: [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2, 7, 12,... -> [4,5,1,2,3]
There are 3 steps for linking the two linked list:
5 ---> 1
3 -/-> 4
head = 4

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

1. Two pointers (slow, fast)</br>
2. Reduce duplicated rotation times</br>
3. Edge cases handling (head == None, k == 0, new_k == 0)</br>
4. Connect 2nd list to the first list

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
    O(N), N = # of nodes
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
    O(1)
# Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # no need to rotate
        if head == None or k == 0: return head

        # Example: [1,2,3,4,5] -> [4,5,1,2,3]
        # get number of nodes in the linked list
        lenOfList = 0
        temp = head
        while temp != None:
            lenOfList += 1
            temp = temp.next
        # get rotation times
        new_k = k % lenOfList

        # no need to rotate
        if new_k == 0: return head

        # "fast" should be ahead of "slow" by new_k nodes
        slow, fast = head, head
        for i in range(new_k):
            fast = fast.next
        # slow at 1 and fast at 3
        
        while fast.next != None:
            slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next
        # slow at 3 and fast at 5
        
        # connect the tail of 2nd list to the front of 1st list
        fast.next = head # connect 5 with 1
        head = slow.next # head is 4
        slow.next = None # 3 is tail

        return head
