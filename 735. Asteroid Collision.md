[735. Asteroid Collision](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/description/)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
I don't know how to start to collide in the first place. Then, I think of the data structure that may solve this issue. It turns out that **STACK** can help me out when doing the collision problem.

Furthermore, in the question, we have leftward and rightward asteroids. When we iterate asteroids from index 0 to N-1, we only need to focus on new asteroid if it is a **leftward** one, in case it **collides with the previous rightware asteroids**. If the new asteroid is a rightward one, we just put it onto the stack.

The next question is, how to deal with the collision? The main idea is to take the top element from the stack and compare it with the new leftward asteriod. We have several outcome after the comparison: two asteroids collide with each other, leftward one is collided, or rightward one on the stack is collided. If the new leftware asteriod successfully destroy the rightward one, we should try to destroy previous rightward asteroids.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
I use diff for coding simplicity

diff = stk[-1] + ast
diff > 0: rightward asteroid is bigger than leftward one, lefttward will be destroyed
diff = 0: both asteroids will be destroyed
diff < 0: leftward asteroid is bigger than rightward one, rightward will be destroyed

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
    O(N)
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
    O(N)
# Code
## V1
```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stk = []
        for ast in asteroids[]:
            # exploding rightward (elements on stack) one by one
            while len(stk) and stk[-1] > 0 and ast < 0:
                diff = stk[-1] + ast
                if diff == 0: # explode each other
                    stk.pop()
                    ast = 0
                elif diff < 0: # destroy rightward element on top
                    stk.pop()
                else:
                    # right > abs(left), left should be destroyed
                    ast = 0
            if ast:
                stk.append(ast)

        return stk
```

## V0
It's more intuative but there are duplicated logic in the code.
```python
class Solution:
    # if stk[-1] > 0 and ast < 0
    # we try to collide asteroids
    def collide(self, stk, ast): 
        # exploding rightward (elements on stack) one by one
        while len(stk) and stk[-1] > 0 and stk[-1] <= -ast:
            if stk[-1] == -ast: # exploding each other
                stk.pop()
                return # left is destroyed
            else: # stk[-1] < -ast, destroy rightward element on top
                stk.pop()
        # nothing on stack or leftward element on top
        if not len(stk) or stk[-1] < 0:
            stk.append(ast)
        else:
            # stk[-1] > -ast, left should be destroyed
            pass

    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stk = [asteroids[0]]
        for ast in asteroids[1:]:
            if ast > 0:
                stk.append(ast)
            else: # leftward
                if not len(stk): # nothing on stack
                    stk.append(ast)
                elif stk[-1] < 0: # leftward on top of the stack
                    stk.append(ast)
                elif stk[-1] <= -ast:
                    self.collide(stk, ast)
                else:
                    # left gone
                    pass
        return stk
```
